Dear Calboza,
The following steps below is the same as shown in the vid but u can doublecheck here if anything went wrong wid u. 
And btw u shud do this steps after setting the localhost with the vid i sent u earlier and these steps u shud follow in every project i will be uploading here 
/*STEP1: Press on the project and then on the green button "clone or download" then click on download zip*/ 
/*STEP2: after downloading the project as a zip file extract it in "C:/xampp/htdocs/phplessons" */ 
/*STEP3: Go to the xampp folder and open "xampp-control.exe" and press "start" beside the "apache" and "sql" to start the localhost*/ 
/*STEP4: open a new tab in google and type "localhost/phpmyadmin" in the url and log in that site*/
/*STEP5: create a new database and name it "hospital_management_system"*/
/*STEP6: now open the project folder u downloaded earlier, inside it u will find a folder called "SQL FOLDER" open it and then open the file inside it with sublime text or notepad and copy all the code inside that file*/ 
/*STEP7: now go the phpmyadmin site again and on top of the page u will find panels press on the "sql" panel where u will find a textarea to type in, paste all the code u copied from the sql file there and then press "Go"*/ 
/*STEP8: now open a new tab and type "localhost/phplessons" in the url and press on the project and there u go done yay*/
